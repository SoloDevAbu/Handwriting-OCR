## Executive Summary

This project implements a comprehensive Handwriting Recognition System using modern machine learning techniques and deep learning models. The system is capable of converting handwritten text from images into digital text through Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The implementation combines TensorFlow for text detection and Tesseract for character recognition, wrapped in a full-stack web application.

    # Convert to grayscale
    # Apply adaptive thresholding
    # Perform denoising
    # Correct skew angle
    # Return normalized image
```

### 3.2 Text Detection
```python
def detect_text_regions(image: np.ndarray) -> list:
    # Use TensorFlow model for detection
    # Process detection map
    # Return region coordinates
```

### 3.3 Text Recognition
```python
def recognize_text(image: np.ndarray, regions: list) -> str:
    # Process each detected region
    # Apply Tesseract OCR
    # Post-process results
    # Return recognized text
```

## 4. Results and Performance
